App requirements per Matt:
(related: learn Markdown.)


User can guess a number between 1 and 9 
– I don't like the number 10...
– I also don't like the number 5, that can never be a right answer 
– I do like cats…. 
 -  I love buMons, I think my app should have 9 buMons, one for each number… also a play again 
buMon would be nice 
 -  The number 5 buMon should have a Cat on it… I love cats… 
 -  As the user guess the numbers, I want those buMons to hide as they are  tapped un:l they get the 
correct answer. 
 -  Users get 4 guess to ﬁnd the number… if they can't ﬁnd it then they lose, and the game resets. 
 -  If a user loses the game 4 :mes, they can't play the game anymore, prevent them from playing 
anymore, even across app restarts! 
 -  When the user wins the game, put a happy cat face toward the boMom. For every subsequent :me 
I win the game, add another happy cat face. Keep track of my happy cat faces across app restarts  
 -  When I get 3 happy cat wins, the game is over and I've conquered the guessing game app. A full 
screen happy cat would be sweet!! 
 -  This is going to be huge, we're going to the top 10 in the Apple store within a week!!!! 
 -  Don't worry, I drew up some screen shots 
 -  Meow...
